This is a friendly fork of [Samuel Kollat](https://github.com/samuel-kollat/generator-ng2-component)

## Installation

First, install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and generator-ng2-component using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)).

```bash
npm install -g yo
npm install -g generator-ng2-comp
```

Then generate your new Angular2 component:

```bash
yo ng2-comp
```

Ensure you include node into your ambientDependencies in typings.json.
```
{
  "ambientDependencies": {
    ...
    "node": "github:DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/node/node.d.ts#138ad74b9e8e6c08af7633964962835add4c91e2"
  }
}
